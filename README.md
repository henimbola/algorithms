# My DSA practice repository

This project is where I am saving all the code I write while learning Data Structures and Algorithms.
We divided it into categories, and each category has its own package.
The code is written in Java. In the future, we may have to categorize by techniques like Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, etc.
For now, let's keep it simple.

## Categories

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
